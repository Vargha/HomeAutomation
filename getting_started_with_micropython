Environment Info:
- MicroController:  ESP8266 (ESP-01)
- OS:               Windows 10
- USB to Serial:    Silicon Labs CP2102 USB to UART Bridge

Preparation:
  - Download CP2102 Driver from silabs.com
  - Download the Stable esp8266 firmware from http://micropython.org/download#esp8266
  - Download ESP8266 Flasher from: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/flashing-nodemcu-firmware-on-the-esp8266-using-windows/
  - Connect GPIO0 to GND and upload the MicroPython firmware.
    - Wire as below to flash:
    •	VCC	=	3.3V (needs around 300-400mA peak)
    •	GND	=	ground
    •	CH_PD	=	Chip enable so always +VCC
    •	RST	=	Leave floating or ground to reset
    •	GPIO0	=	Normally floating but this needs to be grounded when you start the update.
    •	UTXD	=	Tx data connect to Tx on FTDI/Serial interface
    •	URXD	=	Rx data connect to Rx of FTDI/Serial interface
  *IMPORTANT NOTE: Keep the laptop plugged in, while updating the firmware, or use an external power for the ESP.
  - After finishing the firmware upload, detach GPIO0 from GND
